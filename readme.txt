Build Theme Framework
--------------------------------

This framework is intended to be used as a starting point for your custom themes. I originally created this framework to aid me in making my own premium themes and thought I should share it. If you are a fan of minimalistic design, it works as a great stand-alone theme too!

Features
-----------

1] Custom menu
2] Custom background
3] Sticky post
4] Clean and minimal code makes it easy to modify to your needs.

Bugs
-----
There may be a bug in the menu code. If the menu extends to two or more lines, it may push the sidebar to the bottom. I've only encountered this error. If it exists, I will fix it in the next major release.

Future Release
---------------
I intend to attach a detailed documentation on how to edit this framework in the next major release.
